Description and Interpretation: This R code loads data from two Excel files 
(sus_data.xlsx and res_data.xlsx) for susceptible and resistant populations,
respectively. It fits dose-response curves using the LL.3 model and calculates 
confidence intervals for predicted values. New dose levels are generated to 
support the curves. The dose 0 (control) was shift a little because would not allow log.
Additionally, data from another Excel file (dose_auxind.xlsx) is loaded and 
prepared for plotting.
